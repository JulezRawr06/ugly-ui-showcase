  <h1>The Ugliest UI I've Ever Seen</h1>

    The UI has a clashing color scheme, more fonts than needed, has an odd text layout with different font sizes and nonsensical
    italicization and boldness, missing images. It is clearly made to showcase what an ugly website truly would be.

    I would improve it by using consistent fonts and font sizes, a more set color scheme, fix up the images and fix the layout 
    for wider screens.
